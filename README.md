# User Endpoint

## Overview

This repo contains the user source code for the [user endpoint](https://user-api-endpoint.herokuapp.com). The endpoint handles *all* that has to do with manipulating user data/information between the application and the data persistency layer (MongoDB Database). This is a stateless RESTful API (GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE).

## User Object

|name|description|type|default|required| 
|---:|---|:---:|:---:|:---:| 
| **`username`** | The username of the user |*string* || true |
| **`password`** |  The **encrypted** password of the user |*string* || true |
| **`email`** | A valid email address of the user to receive notifications with |*string* || true |
| **`steamid`** | The unique base64 id attributed to each Steam user |*integer* |*null* | false |
| **`created_at`** | The time at which the account was created | *datetime* |
| **`token`** | The temporary valid token of the the user to be used instead of the username/password credentials |*string* |
| **`auth:enabled`** | Determines whether the user has two factor authentification enabled on the account. If enabled, login method changes for this user globally. If a smartphone  application were to be developped and the user signed in, they would go through the two-step verification process |*boolean* | false |
| **`auth:secret`** | The secret used to generate 2FA token. **server-sided only** |*string* | null |
